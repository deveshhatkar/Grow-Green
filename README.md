# Grow-Green
With the unprecedented growth of cities and migration of people from Rural to Urban Areas, a heavy toll is being levied on Nature. The GreenSpace (i.e the forested land or uncemented land) is continuously decreasing with the expansion of cities to accomodate more people. It is expected that around 3 billion people will migrate from Rural to Urban areas by 2050. To ensure sustainable development and expansion of Urban Areas, organizations suggest that 15% of total area of construction should be kept aside for GreenSpace development. Here is where our project comes in, we plan to scrutinize the images of Urban Areas captured by satellites and calculate the overall GreenSpace to ConstructionSpace Ratio in order to monitor it. In case if it is found that GreenSpace is less (then the suggested Ratio), our application will generate a warning message as well as suggestions as to which areas have the potential to be transformed into GreenSpace, inside the periphery of a City. Hence, the main aim of our project is to ensure that the GreenSpace to ConstructionSpace equilibrium is maintained and suggest ways to do so if it is not.

How to Run:
-----------

Just clone this repository and execute the 'GrowGreen.py' file.

The 'img' folder has images to be processed upon. In the program you have to input the image number (eg. 1, 2, 3) and a value for k which is the number of segments you want in the image to be formed.

The segmentation occurs on basis of color.
